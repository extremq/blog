I am a person who enjoys learning new things. I have a lot of hobbies and I am certain you have too.

There are a lot of new things we would like to learn, but we often dread the start. You know, the *beginner* phase. 

In that phase, things are not smooth -- we often question our ability, our motivation, our time.

However, we know that these doubts are not valid. There isn't anything a person cannot learn. It's what has brought us to the modern world.

But it is still challenging. That difficulty just *won't go away*!

Even worse -- if it's not difficult, it usually means we are not learning new things.

Is there a way to make this difficulty more bearable?

# Interconnections

I have observed something rather interesting: 

We can find way more grit and strength to push through if we *bring another hobby* into the mix.

Let me give you some examples that I hope will help you understand what I mean:

## 1. Learning to code
I attempted to learn to code when I was 14. I checked out what my sister was studying at her highschool and seeing her code in C++ was fascinating to me.

I started some random tutorial on YouTube, but I quickly gave up. It just did not catch on with me.

However, one year later, our school asked us to solve some programming problems using C++. These were basic, easy math problems disguised as a coding thing.

Solving these problems gave me the power to visualize what I could build with programming.

This time around, I got hooked. Seriously hooked -- all because maths gave it a meaning. 

If it weren't for that, I don't think I would've pursued an engineering degree centered around computers!

## 2. Learning Calisthenics
In calisthenics[^calisthenics], you can progress from being able to do one push-up to being able to levitate your whole body only with your hands.

I wanted to do that too. However, I could only do simple exercises instead. They were difficult and did not feel that amazing to accomplish.

At some point, I started reading about the physics of calisthenics and the human body. I found out about how we function, how our muscles are created, how the brain uses muscles and learns to use them better.

I found out about a lot of things.

It was exciting. That happened because science, something I enjoy a lot, crossed paths with calisthenics, something difficult for me. Suddenly, it became a matter of studying my body and evolving myself.

Integrating science with calisthenics was what helped me push through.

## 3. Learning to draw
This is something I really admire. I had attempted it in the past, but this time I did it differently -- and it feels different. 

I decided that I would create a website to post my drawings, to see my progress. This would also be an opportunity to learn modern web development.

The website is [here](https://desenez.eu/){:target="_blank"}.

I also feel like making this website public inspires me to do my best and not give up. I will be able to see my progress and I will be able to share it with others.

It really made me enjoy the process more. I know that I will have something to post at the end of the day, and that is a great feeling for me. The number of people who view it is not important.

# Conclusion
Closing thoughts:
- **Interconnect** your hobbies with other things you enjoy. It will make the process more enjoyable.
- **Share** your progress with others. It will make you feel more accountable and it will give you a sense of purpose.
- **Don't give up.** You can do it. You just need to find the right way to do it.

I hope you found this information valuable.
