I'm Extremq[^name-explanation], I was granted life in 2002, and I love creating!

The domain of this site, **suntdoar.eu**, comes from "Sunt doar eu" which means "It's just me" in Romanian[^translation].

I've been programming since I was 15, and I've been doing it professionally since I started my second year at TUIASI.

I work with a lot of clients and their data by creating scalable solutions for their needs. AI, ML, and data science are my main interests.

Outside of work, I mainly spend my time practicing my calisthenics skills, running and starting new projects with my friends!

# Contact

Take a look at my projects on [GitHub]({{ site.github }}) and [YouTube]({{ site.youtube }}), or just send me an email at [{{ site.email }}](mailto: {{ site.email }}).

[^name-explanation]: I created this username when I was playing [Transformice](https://transformice.com) back in fourth grade. "Extreme" was a cool name to me but it wasn't available, so I came up with "Extremq".
