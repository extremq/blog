I'm Extremq[^name-explanation], I was granted life in 2002, and I love creating!

The domain of this site, **suntdoar.eu**, comes from "Sunt doar eu" which means "It's just me" in Romanian[^translation].

I've been programming since I was 15 and started doing it professionally during my second year at TUIASI.

I work with a lot of clients and their data by creating scalable solutions for their needs. AI, ML, and data science are my main interests.

Outside of work, I mainly spend my time practicing my calisthenics[^calisthenics] skills, running and starting new projects with my friends!

# Contact

Take a look at my projects on [GitHub]({{ site.github }}){:target="_blank"} and [YouTube]({{ site.youtube }}){:target="_blank"}, or just send me an email at [{{ site.email }}](mailto: {{ site.email }}){:target="_blank"}.

[^name-explanation]: I created this username when I was playing [Transformice](https://transformice.com){:target="_blank"} back in fourth grade. "Extreme" was a cool name to me but it wasn't available, so I came up with "Extremq".
[^translation]: If you don't trust me, maybe you will trust [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/?sl=ro&tl=en&text=Sunt%20doar%20eu.&op=translate){:target="_blank"}.
[^calisthenics]: [Calisthenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics){:target="_blank"} is a form of strength training that uses your own body weight as resistance. I will be able to do a [Planche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planche_(exercise)) one day.
